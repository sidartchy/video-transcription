Sir, you're out of order. I don't. I show you on order. You don't know what that order is, Mr. Trash. I'd show you, but I'm too old. I'm too tired. I'm too ******* blind. If I were a man I was five years ago, I'd take a flamethrower to this place. Out of order? Who the hell do you think you're talking to? I've been around, you know. There was a time I could see and I have seen boys like these younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off, but there is nothing like a sight of an amputated spirit. There is. No prosthetic for that. Youth.
